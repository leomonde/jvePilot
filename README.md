# **Safety Notes**
* This is my experimental branch, so I'm not responsible for any damage this may cause.
* jvePilot still does not have direct control of the gas and brakes!
  Changing the ACC speed does not always result in the vehicle braking unless the difference in speed is large enough.
  If the speed difference is small, the vehicle just lets off the gas.
* ACC can't go slower that 20mph
* ACC doesn't do a good job at seeing things that are already stopped

# jvePilot 
I have a 2018 Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, so I'm only able to confirm features using this vehicle.
* Pacifica also confirmed to be working

## What is this Fork?
This is my personal OpenPilot fork that includes features that I feel make it a better driving experience for me and possibly others.

## Benefits of jvePilot
* Smother driving in traffic as jvePilot will do a better job at predicting traffic and adjust ACC speed accordingly
* ACC braking by setting the cruse speed lower that the target to help slow the vehicle sooner
* Slow for cars cutting in before ACC does
* Slow in a turn, so you don't have to change the set speed yourself (Speeds are configurable)
* Always On Lateral Control so steering is active even if ACC isn't
* Auto enable ACC on start
* Auto resume after ACC comes to a stop behind vehicle (Can be disabled)
* Auto follow feature to adjust the follow distance based on speed (Speeds are configurable)
* ACC Eco to limit the throttle when accelerating  
* Syncs jvePilot display speed with the vehicle speedometer 
* Use LKAS button in the dash to toggle Experimental Mode if Experimental Mode is enabled in the settings
* Gas/brake indication using green/red colors on speed indicator

### Longitudinal control
This fork combines the speed control logic of OpenPilot with the vehicles Adaptive Cruse Control (ACC).
It does this by changing the ACC speed to match the value OpenPilot calculates as the desired speed.
This brings some of OpenPilots longitudinal control to these vehicles.
Including things like slowing while cornering and slowing when it detects cut-ins.
It will also smooth the braking of ACC when driving in traffic.

On FCA vehicles, only the steering is controlled by jvePilot and speed is left up to the ACC of the vehicle.
This fork takes control of the ACC speed setting and adjusts the ACC speed to match the speed jvePilot would be targeting if it actually was able to control the gas and brakes.
It does this by simulating ACC+ and ACC- button presses on the steering wheel to change the ACC speed.
It is limited as ACC only goes down to 20 mph, so it doesn't help as low speeds.

### Always On Lateral Control
Always On Lateral Control, or AOLC, is a feature that allows jvePilot to steer even if ACC isn't actively engaged.  
Enabling this feature will allow a driver to take control of gas/brakes while still retaining the automatic steering provided by jvePilot.
Because the low torque applied to the steering, it's very easy to override the steering if needed.

### Auto Resume
ACC will come to a stop behind vehicles, however, if stopped too long, it will either stay stopped until resume is pressed, or simply disengage ACC altogether.  
For the case where ACC simply cancels, the driver has to press and hold the brake to keep the vehicle stopped.
Auto resume makes life easier by resuming ACC when the vehicle in front of you begin to move, or, you let off the brake after coming to a standstill.
While stopped, you can still disengage jvePilot by pressing the Cancel button. 

### Auto Follow
Auto Follow is a way to automate the changing of the stock follow distance setting.
It sets the follow distance to closer at slow speeds and increases it the faster you go.
Setting the follow speed to one/two bars helps with keeping up with cars that take off when stopped or at slow speeds.
The faster you go, the more distance you want, so you can have more confidence in ACC being able to stop in case it needs to.

The current enabled state of Auto Follow is as an icon above the ACC Eco button on the jvePilot display.
Pressing Follow + or - will disable Auto Follow giving you full control to set the follow distance. 
To re-enable Auto Follow, hold either Follow + or - for half a second. 
 
### ACC Eco
When enabled, jvePilot will limit how far ahead the ACC setting is above the current speed.  
This prevents the vehicle from using an aggressive throttle to get up to speed saving on gas/battery.

The ACC Eco button is located in the lower right corner of the display.  
Tapping the button cycles between off, level 1, and level 2 eco settings.
Level 2 provides the slowest acceleration and is selected when both leaves are green.    
Level 1 should provide a balance is selected when only one leaf is green.
If you feel these settings are not right for you or your vehicle, see the [ACC Eco](#acc-eco) setting to adjust them. 
Much like your vehicles eco/sport modes, the current setting is persisted between drives.

## How to use it 
When using this branch, you will be setting the max ACC speed on the jvePilot display instead of the one in the dashboard.
jvePilot will then set the ACC setting in the dashboard to the targeted speed, but never exceeding the max speed set on the jvePilot display.
A quick press of the ACC+ and ACC- buttons will change this speed by 5 mph on the jvePilot display, while a long deliberate press (about a 1/2 second press) changes it by 1 mph.
DO NOT hold the ACC+ or ACC- buttons for longer that a 1 second. Either make quick or long deliberate presses only.

### Where to look when setting ACC speed
Do not look at the dashboard when setting your ACC max speed.
Instead, only look at the one on the jvePilot display.
The reason you need to look at jvePilot is because jvePilot will be changing the one in the dashboard.
It will be adjusting it as needed, never raising it above the one set on the jvePilot display.

**ONLY look at the MAX speed on jvePilot when setting the ACC speed instead of the dashboard!**

# Install

The easiest way to install jvePilot is to factory reset your [C3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNnRmEyVSVQ) and use this Custom Software URL: `https://bit.ly/jvePilot-release`

## Branches
`/jvePilot-release` - The latest release.  Will contain the latest version I feel is ready for daily use. Custom Software URL: `https://bit.ly/jvePilot-release`

`/jvePilot-beta` - Sometimes I have people wanting to beta test jvePilot's new features.  Mostly stable, but still can be buggy. Custom Software URL: `https://bit.ly/jvePilot-beta` 

`/feature/*` - These branches are where I'm working on new features.  These are never safe to run as they change all the time.

---
# Customizing
Customizing features and parameters can be done on the UI display.  
Click the gear icon and then select jvePilot from the sidebar.  
Clicking on the text of feature of will show more information about it and allow customization of the feature.
Note that some settings do require a vehicle restart, and some don't 
The settings that don't require a restart may take upward of 5 seconds to take effect after changing them. 


## Slow in Curves
jvePilot will slow in curves so that you don't have to.
* Default: On
* Vehicle Restart Required: No
### Speed Ratio

## ACC Eco
ACC Eco limits acceleration by keep the ACC cruise speed closer to your current speed.
These setting are how far ahead, in MPH, of your current speed ACC will be set.  
The higher the number, the more aggressive ACC will be when accelerating.
### Keep ahead at ACC Eco level 1
Use this setting to adjust ACC Eco level 1 (one green leaf) for a balance of speed and eco-ness  
* Default: 7

* Vehicle Restart Required: No

# ACC Ready on Start
When enabled, jvePilot will enable ACC on start   
* Default: True

# Advanced settings
These settings are for advanced users doing advanced things. 

### Minimum Steer Check  
When disabled, jvePilot will no longer put a minimum on steer speed.
Requires a mod like a [hardware interceptor](https://github.com/xps-genesis/panda/tree/xps_wp_chrysler_basic).
* Default: True 
* Vehicle Restart Required: Yes

### Vision Only
When enabled, the model will no longer use any radar signals and rely on vision only.

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).
